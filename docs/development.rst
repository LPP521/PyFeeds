Writing a custom spider
=======================
Feeds already supports a number of websites (see :ref:`Supported Websites`) but
adding support for a new website is easy.


Reusing an existing feed
------------------------
In such cases you usually only want to augment the original feed with the full
article.

Generic spider
``````````````
For a lot of feeds (especially those from blogs) it is actually sufficient to
use the :ref:`spider_generic` spider which can extract content from any
website using heuristics.

Note that a lot of feeds (e.g. those generated by Wordpress) actually contain
the full text but it is just not shown in your feed reader. In such cases you
can also use the :ref:`spider_generic` spider and add your feed URL to the
``fulltext_urls`` key in the config.

Custom extraction
`````````````````
These spiders take an existing RSS feed and inline the article content while
cleaning up the content (removing share buttons, etc.):

  * :ref:`spider_addendum.org`
  * :ref:`spider_arstechnica.com`
  * :ref:`spider_derstandard.at`
  * :ref:`spider_gnucash.org`
  * :ref:`spider_lwn.net`
  * :ref:`spider_openwrt.org`
  * :ref:`spider_orf.at`

Paywalled content
`````````````````
If your website has a feed but some or all articles are behind a paywall or
require to login to read, take a look at the following spiders:

  * :ref:`spider_lwn.net`
  * :ref:`spider_nachrichten_at`
  * :ref:`spider_uebermedien.de`

Creating a feed from scratch
----------------------------
Some websites don't offer any feed at all. In such cases we have to find an
efficient way to detect new content and extract it.

Utilizing an API
````````````````
Some use a REST API which we can use to fetch the content.

  * :ref:`spider_facebook.com`
  * :ref:`spider_falter.at`
  * :ref:`spider_oe1.orf.at`
  * :ref:`spider_tvthek.orf.at`
  * :ref:`spider_vice.com`

Utilizing the sitemap
`````````````````````
Others provide a sitemap_ which we can parse:

  * :ref:`spider_profil.at`

Custom extraction
`````````````````
The last resort is to find a page that lists the newest articles and start
scraping from there.

  * :ref:`spider_ak.ciando.com`
  * :ref:`spider_atv.at`
  * :ref:`spider_biblioweb.at`
  * :ref:`spider_cbird.at`
  * :ref:`spider_help.gv.at`
  * :ref:`spider_indiehackers.com`
  * :ref:`spider_puls4.com`
  * :ref:`spider_usenix.org`
  * :ref:`spider_verbraucherrecht.at`
  * :ref:`spider_wienerlinien.at`
  * :ref:`spider_zeit.diebin.at`

For paywalled content, look at:

  * :ref:`spider_falter.at`
  * :ref:`spider_konsument.at`
